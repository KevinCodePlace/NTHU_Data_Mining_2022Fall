## Lab 1: Text Data Analysis and Classification

### Objective

The objective of Lab 1 is to follow a predefined process for data analysis on a new dataset, leveraging and modifying existing code when necessary. This lab focuses on generating TF-IDF features, data visualization, and implementing Naive Bayes classifiers.

### Tasks

1. **Dataset Download and Preparation**: Download the new dataset containing sentences and score labels. Read the dataset's specifications for details.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Generate meaningful new data visualizations. Look for inspiration in online resources and the Data Mining textbook.
   - Generate TF-IDF features from the tokens of each text, creating a document matrix with TF-IDF values instead of word frequency.
   - Implement two Naive Bayes classifiers using TF-IDF features and word frequency features, respectively. Compare the differences.

### Instructions

- You are allowed to use and modify the helper functions from the first lab session's folder or create your own.
- Minimal comments explaining your code are appreciated for clarity.

### References

- For TF-IDF feature generation, refer to the [Scikit-learn guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html#tfidf-term-weighting).
